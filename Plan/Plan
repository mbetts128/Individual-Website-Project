to do due dilegence on stock investments. It could allow a person to make notes and see news events that correspond with stock market price changes. Insider trading could be charted there too from an API. PE ratio, dividend, and beta could also be listed there as well, + net book value or a link to a 10k. I could include iframes of stocks as well. The three pages will be 1) charts 2) charts with news/annotation places 3) ratios/stats as compared to S&P 500 in bar chart form (a web crawl to chatgpt about the most important thing about this stock)
